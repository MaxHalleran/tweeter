# Tweeter Project v1.0.0

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

## Devlog

v1.0.0 - Tweeter now has full base functionality. Updates with increased capability are incoming.

v0.9.0 - Minute changes focused on polishing tweeter and reaching version 1

v0.8.0 - Tweeter now uses a database (MongoDB) to store tweets and preserve them while offline.

v0.1.1 - Tweeter compose button is ~functional. Tweets seem to be getting stuck 'in the pipe' and I will need to revisit the refetching of tweets.

v0.1.0 - Tweeter is functional, user is able to tweet, the tweet feed updates automatically on submission and input is parsed of html elements. There is a noticeable lag when submitting tweets that I believe is added on purpose by the built in submission delay function.

v0.0.2 - Initial styling is finished. Now adding a character counter to the post creator

v0.0.1 - Starting the project, first day of work
